Extract coordinates normalized between -1 und +1. We just extract the point coordinates of the start/end points of the bezier splines and don't do any interpolation (the interpolation was done in inkscpae by selecting all points of the path and repeatedly pressed Shift-I to insert new points along the path, in effect doubling the number of points). For fft purposes before this operation the number of points was padded to a power of two by manually inserting points along the path.

(normalize-coords (get-coords *path*))

Test Result: Redefine path with line segments instead of the original bezier splines (and paste the result into an svg document)

(let ((coords (normalize-coords (get-coords *path*))))
  (format nil "M ~{~a~^,~} L ~{~{~a~^,~} ~}" (first coords) (rest coords)))
